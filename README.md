# eclectic
 A Minecraft 1.18.1 mod for random toys and ideas. Like all my mods, this is a learning experience, so don't expect things to be terribly clean in the codebase. If you're here with an issue to report, please do so! I'll try to respond when I have time.
 
 As for porting and such, I'm a college student so I may or amy not have time to do that depending on when new versions come out and what changes. I'm not doing anything too too fancy yet so, hopefully porting will be easy.
